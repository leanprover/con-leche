= What we left out <sec:left-out>

The fragment of §2–§4 is the real checker with everything removed that
does not change the shape of the argument. This section lists what was
removed, with one sentence on what the real proof does about it and a
link to the code. Then it describes where the real proof's
architecture differs from the fragment's on the features they share.

== Dropped features

#left-out[Projections][Lean's primitive projection `e.i`, the `i`-th
field of a structure value. For every inductive type with one
constructor and no index the checker stores #src("ConLeche/Kernel/Inductives/BlockTail.lean", 106, 109)[a
projection table], the fields' types read off the constructor. The
real checker #src("ConLeche/Rules/Rel.lean", 169, 185)[reduces a projection of a
constructor application to that field] and #src("ConLeche/Rules/Rel.lean", 628, 638)[infers its type from
the table]\; in the model a structure value is the tagged tuple of
@sec:ext-eta and a projection reads a component, which
#src("ConLeche/Model/Inductives/BlockStageTables.lean", 10, 12)[the
install of the table] establishes
(#src("ConLeche/Model/Inductives/FixKit.lean", 713, 718)[its typing
and ι laws]).]

#left-out[Mutual inductive types][Several types declared together,
each constructor free to mention any of them. The real checker
checks such a block the same way as a single type, with
a tuple of operators, one per type of the block, and each type's
family is a component of their #src("ConLeche/SetTheory/Derive/LfpTuple.lean", 8, 12)[simultaneous
least fixed point]. The argument is the one for a single type, with
more indices, so this document skips it.]

#left-out[Nat and String literals, and the fast Nat path][Numerals and
strings are terms of their own; the checker expands a literal to its
constructor form when reduction needs it
(#src("ConLeche/Rules/Rel.lean", 144, 146)[natLit],
#src("ConLeche/Rules/Rel.lean", 151, 153)[strLit]) and folds #src("ConLeche/Rules/Rel.lean", 156, 159)[`Nat.succ`] and #src("ConLeche/Rules/Rel.lean", 163, 168)[the
binary `Nat` operations] on literals with machine arithmetic. The folding is sound only for
the operations as the toolchain defines them, so the checker compares
each stream's definition against #src("ConLeche/Kernel/NatOpPins.lean", 8, 21)[a pinned copy] and the model
#src("ConLeche/Model/NatEqs.lean", 1078, 1082)[establishes the operations' recurrences] from that comparison.]

#left-out[Quotients][`Quot`, `Quot.mk`, `Quot.lift`, `Quot.ind` and the
axiom `Quot.sound` are installed from #src("ConLeche/Kernel/Basis/Quot.lean", 8, 14)[a built-in pin] and modelled by #src("ConLeche/SetTheory/Derive/Quot.lean", 65, 67)[the
set-theoretic quotient of a set by a relation], for which the pinned
constants are #src("ConLeche/Model/BasisQuot.lean", 2431, 2435)[shown to be members of their types].]

#left-out[Pinned blocks][In the fragment `False` is whatever empty
proposition the stream declares. The real checker installs `Eq`,
`Nat`, `Empty`, `False` and the quotient `Quot` from hand-written
copies of the toolchain's declarations
(#src("ConLeche/Kernel/Basis/False.lean", 37, 39)[`False`, for instance],
#src("ConLeche/Kernel/Basis/Builder.lean", 9, 18)[the builder]): a
stream block that carries a pin's names and agrees with it up to
renaming of universe parameters
#src("ConLeche/Kernel/Basis.lean", 64, 67)[installs the pin], and one that
disagrees is rejected. The pins are how the main theorem
can name `False` and `Eq` and say what they denote.]

#left-out[Axioms][The fragment has none. The real checker accepts
exactly Lean's three standard axioms: `propext` and `Classical.choice`,
each #src("ConLeche/Kernel/StdAxioms.lean", 8, 15)[pinned to the toolchain's statement] and each #src("ConLeche/Model/AxiomMem.lean", 635, 641)[true in the
model] (`propext` by the extensionality of truth values, `choice` by
choice in the meta-logic), and `Quot.sound` as
part of the pinned `Quot` block above. Any other axiom record declines
the stream, with two tolerated exceptions: a declared but unused
`sorryAx` installs nothing, and Lean's deprecated compiler-trust axioms are
accepted as pinned definitions of their own types.]

#left-out[Opaques][The fragment has definitions and theorems
(@sec:modular), the latter stored as their statements. The real
checker never unfolds a theorem or an opaque: #src("ConLeche/Rules/Rel.lean", 138, 141)[only a definition
unfolds].]

#left-out[Structure η and unit-likeness][The checker has
#src("ConLeche/Rules/Rel.lean", 467, 470)[structure η] and
#src("ConLeche/Rules/Rel.lean", 495, 500)[unit-likeness] as Lean has them;
@sec:ext-eta and @sec:ext-unit derive both from extensionality.]

#left-out[Recursors on stuck proofs of `A ∧ B`][The checker never
unfolds a theorem, while the official kernel does. Some elaborated
terms rely on that, with a case split on a stuck proof `h` of `A ∧ B`.
There the recursor #src("ConLeche/Rules/Rel.lean", 307, 332)[fires on `And.intro h.1 h.2`],
the constructor applied to `h`'s two projections, built from `h`'s
type.]

#left-out[Fuel, memo tables, the executable checker and its bridge
theorem][In the fragment the relations are the checker. The real
checker is a program, connected to the relations by further theorems
(@sec:differs).]

#left-out[The two-phase parallel fold][#src("ConLeche/Cached/Installed.lean", 441, 446)[The fold] installs every
declaration first and then checks the recorded declarations one by one,
each against the prefix of the environment it was installed at\; the binary runs the
second phase on #src("ConLeche/Cached/Installed.lean", 341, 352)[a pool of workers] whose results are reassembled in
record order, so its verdict is the fold's. #src("ConLeche/Verify/Cached/MainC.lean", 37, 40)[The proof reads an
accept of the fold] as an environment in which every declaration was
checked where it was installed, which is what the one-declaration-at-a-time
argument of §3 and §4 needs.]

== How the real proof differs from the fragment <sec:differs>

*Free variables carry their types.* The paper uses named variables and a
context. The real checker keeps no context at all. When it opens a binder it
substitutes a free variable that carries its own type,
#src("ConLeche/Kernel/Expr.lean", 315, 317)[`fvar idx type`], identified by the depth at which it was opened\; so a variable is never
looked up, the relations are indexed by the opening depth in place of a
context, and two free variables are #src("ConLeche/Rules/Rel.lean", 380, 381)[compared by depth alone]. Stored types are closed
terms, and `Denotes`, the relation the main theorem is stated over
(below), reads them with de Bruijn indices under binders, with no
opening at all.

*An intermediate term language.* The real proof does not interpret the
checker's terms directly. It first reads a term into a smaller language,
#src("ConLeche/Term/Syntax.lean", 188, 219)[`Term`]: de Bruijn
indices, sorts at concrete numbers (the level valuation already
applied), and built-in constants at concrete levels. That reading,
#src("ConLeche/Verify/Denote.lean", 153, 154)[`denote`], is partial only for
syntactic reasons: an unknown constant, a wrong number of levels, or a
projection with no table. The interpretation
#src("ConLeche/Semantics/Interp.lean", 134, 145)[`interp`] then maps
the term to a set, reading each binder off the values
as @sec:interp does. The paper folds the two steps into one
denotation on the terms themselves.

*Six relations, and a mode index.* Beside reduction,
definitional equality and inference the real description has three
more: #src("ConLeche/Rules/Rel.lean", 640, 649)[the certification of an argument spine against
a binder telescope] (the certified case of $iota$),
#src("ConLeche/Rules/Rel.lean", 651, 656)[pairwise definitional equality], and
#src("ConLeche/Rules/Rel.lean", 508, 547)[the congruence of two lambda telescopes]
(@sec:tax). A rule with a premise about a list or a telescope needs a
relation of its own in a mutual block; the paper inlines them into the
rules that use them. Inference also carries a
mode index, for `infer_only` (@sec:io), which the fragment
states as a relation of its own.

*The bridge and the recomposition.* Because the real checker is a
program, its proof has three parts where the paper has one. #src("ConLeche/Verify/Rules/Bridge.lean", 30, 33)[The bridge] turns an accepting
run at any fuel into a derivation, by one induction on fuel in which
each checker site lands on one rule. #src("ConLeche/Model/Rules/Sound.lean", 49, 50)[The soundness] is the paper's
induction: one structural induction over the six relations, each case a
lemma about one rule, never mentioning the implementation. #src("ConLeche/Model/Rules/Recompose.lean", 50, 55)[The
recomposition] puts them together, claim by claim. It bridges the run,
applies the soundness, and hands the result to the declaration fold.

*The statement over `Denotes`.* The main theorem is stated over #src("ConLeche/Denotes.lean", 121, 124)[`Denotes`], a relation on the checker's
own terms with one rule per syntax form, written to be read in one
sitting, and over the structure #src("ConLeche/Denotes.lean", 248, 268)[`Model`] built on it. #src("ConLeche/Model/Denotes.lean", 192, 198)[A theorem]
connects the two: wherever the reading `denote` exists, its
interpretation is a `Denotes`-denotation of the term. The paper's theorem is
the model side directly.

*The cached checker and its simulation.* The core the binary runs is #src("ConLeche/Cached/CoreC.lean", 8, 11)[a
clone of the pure one] over a term representation that carries a
precomputed hash in every node, with memo tables for reduction,
equality and inference. #src("ConLeche/Verify/Cached/SimC.lean", 10, 15)[A simulation proof] shows
that every successful run of the cached core is a successful run of the
pure fuelled core at some fuel, with the memo tables' invariant
preserved\; the main
theorem #src("ConLeche/Verify/Cached/MainC.lean", 37, 40)[composes it with the fold's soundness].

*The frontend.* Between the export file and the declaration fold sit
a decoder and one transformation of the decoded list,
#src("ConLeche/Frontend/Prepare.lean", 171, 172)[`preparePrelude`].
It moves the declarations of a built-in copy of the toolchain's
prelude (`Eq`, `Nat`, `Bool` and their kin) to the front, the stream's
own record where it has one and the copy's where it has none, and it
moves the structural `Nat` operations that a pinned `Nat` operation is
defined from ahead of it.
#src("ConLeche/Verify/Frontend/Prepare.lean", 160, 161)[A theorem
says that this is all]. The fold's input is a permutation of the
decoded list plus records of the built-in prelude, and nothing is
rewritten or generated. What no theorem says is that the decoded
list means the same as the export file: the decoder is written to be
meaning-preserving, and that is a review claim. The fragment has no
frontend: its stream is its environment.
