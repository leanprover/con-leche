This document records the design of `Setlec/TTVerify/*`.  It lives here
while the work is on its own branch (the same reason
`Setlec/TT/DESIGN.md` does), and folds into the top-level `DESIGN.md`
when the branch merges.

## 1. What the bridge is

A second verification path for the checker: instead of interpreting a
real `Env` + `Expr` into the set model, interpret it into the
declarative type theory of `Setlec/TT/*` and conclude with a `HasType`
derivation.  Both paths coexist; nothing in `Setlec/Model/*` is
replaced, weakened or deleted.

Layering: `Setlec/TTVerify/*` may import `Setlec/TT/*`,
`Setlec/Kernel/*` and `Setlec/Verify/*`.  The checker never imports it,
and `Setlec/TT/*` stays checker-free — every adaptation lives on this
side.  Its own `lean_lib` target is `SetlecTTV`.

The subject is the **pure knot** (`Setlec.Kernel.TypeChecker` at
`CheckM`): plain `Expr`, no arena, no caches, fuel-bounded open
recursion.  The descent from the executing checker (interned twins,
memoized knot) already exists in `Setlec/Verify/*` and is inherited;
this bridge proves nothing new about the arena or the caches.
`CoreNC.lean` is outside all of it and stays so.

## 2. The decision that shapes everything: mirror `EnvModel`

`Setlec/TT/DESIGN.md` §2.1 describes the denotation as *unfolding*
constants — definitions to their values, modeled inductives to their
`_model` artifacts — by well-founded recursion on the environment.
**Task #119 does not do that.**  It carries a valuation instead:

```
TConstVal := Name → (Name → Nat) → VExpr        -- cf. ConstVal V
denote : TConstVal → Env → (Name → Nat) → Nat → Expr → Option VExpr
```

which is `Setlec/Model/Interp.lean`'s `interpExpr` with the
set-theoretic universe replaced by the syntax, clause for clause.  The
`.const` clause reads `cval`, exactly as `interpExpr` does, and the
environment invariant records (`EnvTT.defn_eq`, transposing
`EnvModel.defn_eq`) that a definition's valuation is its body's
denotation.

This is the same theory, arrived at the way the set model already
arrives at it: **the recursion on the environment becomes the
incremental construction of the valuation as declarations install.**
That construction is the existing `checkDecl_sound` induction, it needs
no new termination argument, and it is exactly the sense in which
"there is no separate ordering concept" — the incremental extension of
the invariant *is* the stream-ordering fact.

**Delta is not a rule of the type theory, and it is not a `refl`
either: it is an equation between denotations that the invariant
already carries.**  This supersedes the "a delta step becomes `refl` on
the TT side, because `D` already unfolded" formulation of the original
sketch.  The payoff is the same one — the reduction strategy drops out
of the consistency argument — reached with less machinery: no
unfolding, no well-founded recursion on the environment, and no
termination obligation to discharge.

### The rest of the transposition

`EnvTT env` is `EnvModel env` field for field:

| `EnvModel` | `EnvTT` |
|---|---|
| `val : ConstVal V` | `cval : TConstVal` |
| `wf`, `val_params` | *the same* |
| `mem_type`: `val c φ ∈ˢ ⟦c.type⟧` | `has_type`: `⊢ cval c φ : ⟦c.type⟧` |
| `defn_eq` | *the same*, at `VExpr` |
| `thm_ok` (equation **+ `AnnotOk`**) | just the equation |
| `annot_ok` | **no counterpart** |
| `ind_ok`'s `Empty` clause | `empty_pinned` |
| `ind_ok`'s other clauses, `rec_rules`, `proj_ok`, `caps_ok`, `nat_ops`, `div_mod`, `reduce_ops` | stage 2; recipe in `EnvTT.lean` |

Two rows carry the whole idea.  `mem_type` becomes a typing judgment —
that is the only change of substance.  And `AnnotOk` **disappears**:
the set model's truthfulness predicate exists to reconstruct, at every
binder, facts a derivation supplies for free, so `annot_ok` has no
field and `thm_ok` loses its second conjunct.

Three further collapses worth naming, all of them consequences of
denoting into syntax rather than into sets:

* **the free-variable valuation `ρ` disappears.**  `interpExpr` needs
  `ρ : Nat → V` because a set is not a variable; here the opened binder
  *is* a variable, and which one it is follows from its own `fvar`
  index and the current depth (`fvar d` at depth `d'` is
  `.bvar (d' - 1 - d)`).  So `updV` has no counterpart, and `FvarsOk`
  (which constrains `ρ`) transposes to a context correspondence
  (which constrains `Δ`).
* **`let` denotes to its zeta reduct**, mirroring `interpExpr`'s
  `letE` clause.  `VExpr.letE` and `HasType.letE` are therefore unused
  by this bridge; they become relevant at task #117, and the two forms
  are interderivable through `HasType.zeta` regardless.
* **level comparison is trivial**, as `Setlec/TT/DESIGN.md` §2.2
  predicted: `.sort u ↦ .sort (u.eval φ)`, and two levels the checker
  calls equal are equal naturals at every `φ`.

## 3. Projections: a gap in the layer, found here and closed

**Recorded because it is the one place the mirroring did not
transpose, and because the fix made the layer smaller rather than
bigger.**

`interpExpr` reads a `.proj` node with the *untyped* `sfst`/`ssnd`.
The layer's `psigmaFst`/`psigmaSnd` were constants **applied to the
pair's type arguments** `A` and `B`.  A `.proj` node does not carry
them; the checker recovers them at use time by whnf-ing the subject's
inferred type.  A denotation that is a function of the expression alone
cannot.  And a *relational* denotation is no escape — the defeq clause
of the fuel induction needs both sides denoted by the same map, or the
two existentials never meet.

`Setlec/TT/DESIGN.md` §3's "projections denote to applications of
`psigmaFst`/`psigmaSnd`" was right for a *modeled* structure, whose
node the checker rewrites away at annotation, and silent about the
**pinned pair**, whose node is first-class by design
(`ProjEntry.native`) and survives into stored terms.  Scale, measured:
188 `proj` records in the preprocessed init-prelude stream, and at
least one in 34 of the committed e2e fixtures.

**Closed on `feat/74-proj-former`** (landed 2026-08-26): `VExpr.proj i
e` carries exactly what the checker's node carries, and
`projFst`/`projSnd` read `A` and `B` off the premise
`Γ ⊢ p : PSigma' A B`.  Same move as the `app` rule, same payoff — the
premise hands soundness the `⟦p⟧ ∈ˢ sigmaSet …` package that the set
model's `AnnotOk` proj clause carries by hand.  One further rule was
needed, `congrProj`: `proj` is not an application, so no existing
congruence reaches it and `conv` changes types rather than terms.

The net effect on the primitive set is **negative**: `psigmaFst` and
`psigmaSnd` are `fun A B p => p.i` and left `BConst`, mechanized in
`Examples.lean` beside `Eq.rec` and `PSigma'.rec`.  That asymmetry is
the argument that the former is a primitive rather than an addition —
it derives the constants, and no set of constants derives it, because
only the former can be typed without its type arguments appearing in
the term.

`denote`'s clause is now the plain transpose of `interpExpr`'s, `i < 2`
guard included.

## 4. What is proved, and what the remaining hypotheses are

Stage 1 (the denotation, the invariant, the fold) and the opening of
stage 2 are proved, `sorry`-free and on
`[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`:

* `EnvTT.empty` — the base of the induction;
* `EnvTT.hasType_defn` / `EnvTT.hasType_thm` — the per-declaration
  conclusion ("this value has a derivation of its stated type") as a
  two-line consequence of `has_type` and `defn_eq`.  That it *is* two
  lines is the payoff of transposing `mem_type` rather than inventing a
  separate declaration-level statement;
* `foldlM_TT` / `checkDecls_TT` — the fold over the stream, reducing
  acceptance to the per-declaration step;
* `no_constant_of_Empty_TT` and `no_proof_of_Empty_TT` — the
  consistency corollary, through `Setlec.TT.no_proof_of_empty`;
* `checkSoundTT` — the mutual fuel induction, with its **fuel-zero**
  case proved outright and its step named (`Setlec/TTVerify/Claims.lean`);
* `denote_mono` — **denotations survive environment extension**
  (`Setlec/TTVerify/Extend.lean`).  This is the workhorse every install
  step needs, in the same place the set model needs its
  `Extend/Transport` family, and it is one lemma here rather than a
  family because nothing in this hierarchy mentions `AnnotOk` or a
  set-theoretic interpretation.

Two hypotheses remain open, both named `Prop`s rather than `sorry`s so
that every consumer of an unproved step is visible in the source:

* `CheckDeclTT` — "checking one declaration preserves the derivation
  model", the transpose of `checkDecl_sound`;
* `CheckStepTT` — the `succ` case of the fuel induction, the
  clause-by-clause transpose of `Setlec/Model/Core/*`.

`CheckDeclTT` will be discharged *through* `CheckStepTT`; they are
separate because the declaration checker and the core knot are separate
inductions on the set-model side too.

Note where the set theory enters: **nowhere in `EnvTT`**.  The
invariant is purely derivation-level; a `SetTheory V` instance is
needed only at `no_constant_of_Empty_TT`, where the layer's own
consistency theorem turns the pinned valuation of `Empty` into
uninhabitation.

### A candidate for the invariant-carrying shape (noted, not acted on)

Every claim in `Setlec/TTVerify/Claims.lean` takes `CtxOk` as a
*hypothesis* and every recursive clause will have to re-establish it
for its subterms — which is a faithful mirror of what the checker does,
and so is what stage 2 builds.

But it is the obvious candidate for a formulation that *carries*
well-typedness instead: `CtxOk` is an invariant of the traversal, not
something each node earns, and subject reduction is free in this layer
(conversion is equality reflection, so a `Deq` never disturbs a
derivation).  Recorded here because a separate investigation is asking
whether a TT-based proof could carry well-typedness through reduction
rather than re-derive it at each node — the discipline behind the
official kernel's `infer_only` mode.  **Not actionable**: it would
require the checker to gain an infer-only mode, which `Core.lean`
currently defers, and stage 2 must mirror what the checker does today.

### The direct-install hypothesis, and what it costs

Stage 2's step is stated for `directStructsEnabled = false`
(`Setlec/Kernel/Direct.lean`, and the top-level `DESIGN.md` section
"The master switch, and why it defaults on").  A directly installed
structure has no `_model` artifact and the denotation of a stored
inductive goes through exactly those artifacts.

**The switch defaults on.  So say the consequence plainly: the TT
consistency result is vacuous for the configuration we actually
ship.**  A reader who finds a conditional theorem here must not
conclude that it covers the binary — it does not, and no amount of
gate-green reporting changes that.

This is acceptable, for exactly two reasons and no others.

1. It is **explicitly staged**.  The hypothesis is a named `Prop`
   argument of every theorem that depends on it, not a hidden side
   condition, so the restriction is visible at each use site.
2. The **set model still covers the full shipped configuration**,
   direct install included — task #82 landed with `checkDecl_sound`
   covering the direct clause, and nothing in task #119 weakens,
   replaces or deletes any of it.  So we lose nothing today: the set
   model remains the shipped guarantee while the TT route is built up
   over a sub-configuration.

**Exit condition.**  The TT route covers the shipped default only once
one of two things happens: the layer supports directly installed
structures (their tower encoding denotes, as
`Setlec/Model/DirectTower.lean` already interprets it), or direct
install is retired — which is the standing plan the moment the class
earns `eta`/`unitlike` and `lean-inductive-models` stops emitting
artifacts for it (top-level `DESIGN.md`, "Task #82 is complete").
Until then, quoting a TT consistency theorem as a statement about the
binary is a category error.

## 5. Interfaces this bridge consumes

* **Nat literals** (`Setlec/TT/Nat/*`, task #119's other half).  The
  lemma families are hypothetical over an arbitrary `f : VExpr` and
  take their recurrences at numerals only, so the layer needs no
  constant for `Nat.add` and the bridge's obligation at a certified
  fast path is: denote the checker's own certificate for that
  operation (which `EnvTT` carries, by the same mechanism that carries
  the `_model` iota theorems), instantiate it at numerals, and hand the
  resulting `Deq` equations to `numeral_add` and friends.  `String`
  literals need nothing: `strLitToConstructor` is finite and explicit.
* **Modeled iota, eta, unit-like, K.**  Not a risk: the `_model`
  theorems are stream declarations the checker *accepted*, so
  `EnvTT.has_type` already supplies a derivation of each by the time
  any later declaration fires the rule.  Firing is instantiation plus
  `trans`.  A propositional equality suffices because conversion in
  this layer is equality reflection.  K needs nothing at all — its
  guard makes it proof irrelevance (the #74 finding).
