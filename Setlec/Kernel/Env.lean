# Declarations and the global environment

Input declarations mirror `Lean.Declaration` (only the kinds the checker
supports so far are present; more are added feature by feature).

The environment is, for now, a simple association list of checked constants.
This is the *verified* reference representation; a faster indexed structure
can replace it later, with a proof that it refines this one.

namespace Setlec

/-- Data common to all constants: name, universe parameters, type. -/
structure ConstantVal where
  name : Name
  levelParams : List Name
  type : Expr
  deriving DecidableEq, Repr, Inhabited

/-- One iota rule of a recursor: applying the recursor (with its
parameters, motives and minors) to a `ctor`-headed major premise reduces
to `rhs` applied to the parameters, motives, minors and the constructor's
`nfields` fields. -/
structure RecRule where
  ctor : Name
  nfields : Nat
  rhs : Expr
  deriving DecidableEq, Repr, Inhabited

/-- Reducibility hint of a definition, mirroring Lean's
`ReducibilityHints`: `abbrev` unfolds first, `opaque` last, `regular`
definitions compare by their definitional height.  The hints steer only
the *order* of lazy delta unfolding in `isDefEq` — never whether two
terms are definitionally equal — so the model and all soundness proofs
are independent of them. -/
inductive ReducibilityHint where
  | «opaque»
  | «abbrev»
  | regular (height : Nat)
  deriving DecidableEq, Repr, Inhabited

namespace ReducibilityHint

/-- `h₁.lt h₂`: `h₁` is strictly less eager to unfold than `h₂` (the
lazy delta step unfolds the greater side to bring the two closer;
`opaque < regular h < abbrev`, regular heights compare by `<`). -/
def lt : ReducibilityHint → ReducibilityHint → Bool
  | _, .opaque => false
  | .abbrev, _ => false
  | .opaque, _ => true
  | _, .abbrev => true
  | .regular h₁, .regular h₂ => h₁ < h₂

/-- Both hints are `regular` at the *same* height — the only situation
in which the reference kernels (nanoda `try_eq_const_app`, the official
kernel) attempt the same-head congruence short-circuit instead of
unfolding.  Deliberately NOT generalized to other equal hints: proof
authors rely on `abbrev` definitions unfolding eagerly, and trying
spine defeq first on `abbrev`-headed applications risks reduction bombs
(spines that are only equal after reduction, retried at every
congruence level). -/

  | .regular h₁, .regular h₂ => h₁ == h₂

else is reduced to these by the lean-inductive-models preprocessor). -/

  deriving DecidableEq, Repr, Inhabited


/-- Definitional capabilities of a stored inductive type, recorded at
install: structural eta for its (single-constructor) values, unit-like
collapse (all inhabitants definitionally equal), and rule K for its
recursor.  The pinned basis blocks carry pinned capabilities; modeled
blocks earn them from checked `_model` theorems. -/

  is-a-proposition requirement — the value is checked against the
  type and the constant is never delta-unfolded. -/
  | opaqueDecl (val : ConstantVal) (value : Expr)
  | basisDecl (kind : BasisKind)
  /-- A preprocessed (modeled) inductive block: type formers,
  constructors and recursors, installed opaquely after checking each
  member against its `_model` counterpart. -/
