# `EnvModelM` — the P-tier environment invariant (task #161, P4)

The install tier's target, per the P4 design note in DESIGN.md: the
denoteAnnot-free environment carrier (`EnvModel`) *contained*, plus the
fields the P bundles read.  (Batch 8 slimmed the containment from
`EnvModelUM` to `EnvModel` — the FINDING in `Annot/EnvModel.lean`: the
P fold stores `denoteMeta`-numeraled leaves and so can never supply the
denoteAnnot-currency fields, which the P surface never reads.)

**The laws the fields are stated over live in `Model/Annot/Laws.lean`**
since task #305 closing — `NatOps`, `DivMod`, `EqLaw`, `ReduceOps`, the
caps kit, the iota kit and the tower kit were in this file until then,
and were moved out (unchanged, docstrings included) so that the rules
tier's inputs can name them without importing the establishment
surface below.  This file keeps the structure, its namespace, the empty
model, and the `Nat`-op guard law the literal tier reads.

The deltas against the canonical fields, each a payoff of the fuel-free
reading:

* **existence, not uniqueness** — `defn_reads` is `AcvalDefnInst`
  (batch 4): a stored definition's or theorem's value *reads*, to the
  constant's own leaf.  The canonical `acval_defn` retreated to a
  uniqueness form because all-fuel existence is refutable
  (`envS2_defn_lam_refuted` — `denoteAnnot` fails on binders at small
  fuel); `denoteMeta` has no fuel, and a checked value is never out of
  fragment.
* **the stored types read, are graded, and are inhabited** —
  `type_reads`/`type_wellDenotedV`/`mem_type`, at the *uninstantiated* type
  over every ground assignment; `denotePInstLevels` (an equality)
  delivers every instantiated form, so no arity or fuel bookkeeping
  appears anywhere.
* **the leaves are bit-valid** — `acval_validV`, `acval_wellDenoted`'s
  `AnnotValid` companion; establishment at install is the P2 front
  door's own validation, transported by the claims.

The bundle-supplying layer below (`constTypeP_of` the worked example;
its siblings follow the same three-field read) is what the quarter
induction (`checkSoundP_of_inputs`) consumes — the structure exists so
that a `Nonempty (EnvModelM …)` carried through the declaration fold
makes the induction's hypotheses *facts*.

it used to re-derive `natOpGuard` per literal hit; the guard is what
the leaf analysis below needs (`natLitSupported` for the numeral
shapes, the two `Bool` constructors for the comparison shapes), and it
is carried by `NatOps`/`DivMod`, whose statement is exactly "stored
