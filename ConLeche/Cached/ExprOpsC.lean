# The cached syntactic operations on `Expr`

The **executed** counterparts of the arena operations in
`ConLeche/Kernel/IExpr.lean` — same clauses, same memo discipline, same
cutoffs; the mechanism differs only in where the derived data lives (a
field of the node instead of a parallel array indexed by the node's
arena position) and in how a rebuilt node is obtained (allocation
instead of a cons-table probe).

Two structural consequences of dropping the arena, both load-bearing
for the pilot's numbers:

* the scope and definedness walks' memos are keyed on `Expr` itself
  (`O(1)` hashing off the cached field, pointer-first equality), so
  shared sub-DAGs are still visited once — a `Std.HashMap Expr α`
  replaces the arena's `Std.HashMap EIdx α` one for one.  The
  SUBSTITUTION walks key theirs by address instead; see "The
  substitution walks" below;
* a cutoff (`bvarB ≤ d`, `fvarB ≤ d`, `!hasLP`) returns the node
  **itself**, so the result shares memory with the input and later
  pointer comparisons on it are `O(1)` — the analogue of the arena
  returning the same index.

/-! ## The substitution walks (tasks #314, #316, #317)

ONE walk per operation — `instantiate1XP`, `instantiate1LiftXP`,
`instantiateListXP`, `instantiateRevXP`, `abstract1XP`,
`abstractRangeXP`, `instLevelParamsXP` — and ONE memo discipline.  The
design, as landed:

* **Memoise only what is shared.**  At every compound node past the
  cutoff the walk asks `withExclusive`
  (`ConLeche/Kernel/Exclusive.lean`) whether the node is an EXCLUSIVE
  object — single-threaded, reference count 1.  An exclusive node
  cannot be reached twice, so it is rebuilt with the memo untouched:
  no key, no probe, no insert.  A shared node (count `> 1`,
  multi-threaded, or persistent — the installed environment) is
  probed and, on a miss, recorded after the rebuild.  The table is
  created at the first shared compound node (`none` until then); the
  root is never probed (it cannot be reached again within its own
  walk).  The official kernel's `replace_fn` caches exactly the
  `!is_likely_unshared(e)` nodes.
* **Key the memo by address and cursor.**  The key is the node's
  address, read by `withPtrAddr` (`Expr.withAddr`) at the top of the
  shared step, packed with the cursor into one `Nat` (`pkey`) — a
  scalar, no allocation, no structural hash.  The table is a
  `Std.HashMap` on that key.
* **Validate a hit by pointer identity.**  A probe that returns an
  entry is believed only after `Expr.ptrDec` (`withPtrEq`, the
  pointer comparison at runtime and the derived structural decision
  in the model) says the stored node IS the current one, and the
  cursors compare equal.  The address is therefore never trusted: a
  wrong key can only cost a rebuild, never a value.
* **Every entry is self-proving.**  A `PEnt` stores its node, its
  rebuild, its cursor and the proof `val = s node depth`.  So there is
  **no table invariant** — the table may be anything, may grow and may
  overwrite — and a validated hit yields the proof the walk's result
  type demands by rewriting along the two equalities.  This is the
  `BeqMap`/`EqPair`/`probeHit` shape of `Expr.beqGo`, applied to the
  walks.
* **No cutoff.**  The walk is exact: it memoises every shared compound
  node it meets, for as long as the walk lasts, and nothing bounds the
  table.  The node budget of task #313 — a heuristic that stopped
  memoising after 256 nodes and restarted — is gone (task #317).

**The borrowed-parameter convention is a REQUIREMENT, not an
optimisation.**  The node is borrowed (`@&`) all the way down, and so
is the replacement.  An owned parameter is a reference of its own, and
the count `withExclusive` reads would then be "in-tree references
+ 1" — every child of a held root would answer shared, and the memo
would degenerate to the always-memoised walk.  Borrowed, the count is
the number of references INSIDE the term (plus the caller's at the
root, which is never asked), which is the question the memo exists to
answer.  **How this is checked**: by reading the generated C of every
walk (`.lake/build/ir/ConLeche/Cached/ExprOpsC.c`) for a surviving
`lean_inc_ref` of the node before `lean_is_exclusive_obj` — the IR
audits of the task #314 and #316 records (DESIGN.md).  A change to
these walks that drops a `@&` or lets a `let`, a closure or a `Prod`
hold the node across the check is silently correct and measurably
slower; the audit is what catches it.

**Verification is intrinsic** (the `Expr.beqGo` shape): a walk returns
a `Squash` of the rebuilt term with its proof of equality to the PLAIN
descent (`*P`, the reference — `Verify/Cached/OpsC.lean` proves each
`*P` equal to the specification) beside the memo, which is
unobservable.  The result is a `Subsingleton`, which is the obligation
`withExclusive` and `withPtrAddr` each ask of their continuation — so
the wrapper's theorem holds whatever the reference count and the
address are, by the primitives' contracts, never by a case analysis on
either.  Each walk's `enter*P` is the child step: the cutoff, the
compound test, then the exclusivity read; its `rec` argument is the
descent itself, inlined, so the recursive call is applied to the
subterm and termination is the walk's own.

Nothing here adds to the trust surface beyond the one allowlisted
escape: `withPtrAddr` and `withPtrEq` are `Init.Util`'s (and the tree
already relies on both, in `Expr.beqGo` and `Name.beq`), and
`withExclusive` is `ConLeche/Kernel/Exclusive.lean`'s — the walks' one
`unsafe`-implemented primitive, whose module docstring is the
justification `tests/trust-surface.sh` points at. -/

/-! ### The memo

The key is the node's ADDRESS packed with the cursor into one `Nat`
(`pkey`: addresses are 8-byte aligned, so `addr / 8`, then the cursor
modulo `2^16` in the low bits — pure register arithmetic, a tagged
scalar, no allocation and no structural hash), and the table is a
`Std.HashMap` on it under a MIXING hash (the address bits are dense;
`hash64` is what `Lean.Ptr` uses, and the identity hash of `Nat` would
cluster them after Std's fold — the intern table's lesson of task
#89).

A structural key `(e, c)` was what the walks used before task #316: a
`Prod` allocation per entry, the node's cached hash mixed with the
cursor, and a `beq` on every probe.  The C++ kernel's `replace_fn`
pays none of that — its cache is an `unordered_map` on the raw `expr`
pointer and the offset — and neither does this.

The price of the cheap key is that the key alone proves nothing, so
the entry does: `PEnt` stores its node, its rebuild, its cursor and
the proof, and `PEnt.hit` believes a probe only after the cursors
compare equal and `Expr.ptrDec` says the stored node IS the current
one.  A key collision (an address reused within one walk cannot happen
— every recorded node is held by its entry and the root by the caller
— but nothing here depends on that) fails validation and is a miss.
Hence **no table invariant at all**: the table may grow, rehash and
overwrite freely, and no lemma about it is needed.

`withPtrAddr`'s own obligation is discharged the same way the rest of
the section's are: the continuation of the address read is the whole
shared-node step and returns a `Squash`, so it is `Subsingleton.elim`
(`Expr.withAddr`).  The address may choose HOW the walk computes —
which slot, which entry is consulted — never WHAT. -/

/-- The packed key: the node's address over its 8-byte alignment,
then the cursor modulo `2^16` in the low bits.  Pure `UInt64` register
arithmetic; a tagged scalar as a `Nat` (addresses are below `2^47`).
In the model the address is `0` and the key is the cursor — the
tables never rely on the key: an entry validates itself. -/

substitution on the direct install's executed path that once had no
memoised twin at all: `structProjBodies` runs it once per field over
the constructor telescope, turning a DAG-shared field type into an
unshared tree each time.  The twin is the section's walk, with the
`bvarB` cutoff (a node bounded at or below the cursor is returned
unchanged).  `instantiate1LiftC_spec`

every parameter in the field type came back as a fresh **tree copy**
of a term that was a DAG.  On a projection chain over a Mathlib
carrier (`(Classical.choice …).ColimitCocone.0.Cocone.0.CommRingCat.0`)
the copies nest, and at `AlgebraicGeometry.isAffine_of_isAffineOpen_basicOpen`

/-! ## The `Bool`-valued walks (task #318)

The scope, definedness and resolution guards each create a
`Std.HashMap` per call, keyed STRUCTURALLY on the node (and, for the
scope walk, the cursor), and record EVERY node they decide.  The
substitution walks of tasks #314–#317 stopped doing that: they ask
`withExclusive` whether the node can be reached again and memoise only
what it reports shared, under a key that is the node's ADDRESS packed
with the cursor, in a table whose entries prove themselves.  This
section is the same treatment for the `Bool`-valued walks, behind a
compile-time switch: `boolMemoMode` selects the incumbent (`.keyed`)
or the variant (`.excl`), the `match` in each wrapper folds, and
NOTHING is decided here — the section exists to be measured
(DESIGN.md, task #318).

The kit is the `PEnt`/`MemoXP` kit with `Bool` in place of the rebuilt
term: an entry carries its node, its cursor, its decision and the
proof `val = s node depth`, so there is **no table invariant**; a
probe is believed only after `Expr.ptrDec` says the stored node IS the
current one and the cursors compare equal; the table is created at the
first shared compound node and the root is never probed.  A walk's
result is a `Squash` of `{ r : Bool // r = <the plain descent> }`
beside the memo — a `Subsingleton`, which is the obligation
`withExclusive` and `withPtrAddr` each ask of their continuation — and
the wrapper reads the decision off it with `resBool`.  The plain
descents (`*P`) carry the incumbent's cutoff and are proved equal to
their `ConLeche.Expr` specifications in
`ConLeche/Verify/Cached/{OpsC,GuardsC}.lean`. -/
