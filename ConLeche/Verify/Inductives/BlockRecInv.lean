# The recursor stage's shared inversions

The counting and pin halves of the elimination guard
(`checkBlockRecSmallElim`, `checkBlockRecElimPin`,
`Kernel/Inductives/BlockInstall.lean`), which the target check runs on
its family, and the two capture-avoiding substitutions at bvar-closed
arguments.  The check's own run records are
`Verify/Inductives/RecCheckRun.lean`; its kind-free facts, the record the
model reads, `Verify/Inductives/RecStage.lean`.

/-! ## The COUNTING half of the elimination guard

`checkBlockRecSmallElim` (`Kernel/Inductives/BlockInstall.lean`) is the
one clause of official's `elim_only_at_universe_zero` the model reads
in the LEVEL currency instead of through a run: at a block whose result
sort may be `0`, a family of more than one member eliminates only at a
level equivalent to zero.  Its inversion is the whole content. -/

/-! ## The two capture-avoiding substitutions, at bvar-closed arguments

`targetIhTy`, `targetCallOk` and `targetRule`'s conclusion are all
built with `Expr.instPisAtLift`, and the ih telescope is opened with
`Expr.instantiateList`; neither has a reading lemma, because both are
written for arguments that may mention the ambient binders.  **At
arguments that are bvar-closed — which is what they are once the rule
body is OPENED, the frame `denoteMeta` reads at — both collapse onto
operations the model already owns**: `instPisAtLift` onto `instPisAt`
(nothing to lift, `instantiate1Lift_eq_instantiate1`), and
`instantiateList` onto `instSeq` (through `instSpine`).  These are the
two syntactic halves of the batteries the model tier needs. -/

    ∀ {as : List Expr} {t : Expr}, (∀ a ∈ as, a.looseBVarsBounded 0 = true) →

covers the ih telescope's opening. -/
