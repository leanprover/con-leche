# The universe question, in the `pt`-free world (task #151, tier B)

Under `interp` there is no `pt` in the positive regime, and the
universe question reads:

> Do `interp`'s universes contain values that break the graph
> inversion at universe-codomain products — i.e. can something the
> `SetTheory` universe tower happens to contain sneak into
> `⟦(x : A) → Sort k⟧` without being a graph?

**No, and the reason is structural rather than arithmetic.**
`piR v A B` at `v ≠ 0` is `piSet A B`, which is *carved out by
separation*: `f ∈ piSet A B` **iff** `f ⊆ sigmaPairs A B` and `f` is
total and single-valued on `A` (`mem_piR_pos_iff` below).  That is a
property of `f`, quantified over `f`'s own members.  Nothing about `B`,
about universe transitivity, or about what a universe contains can add
a member to it: universe transitivity says members of members of `U`
are in `U`, which enlarges `U`, never `piSet A B`.  So
`interp_mem_pi_pos` holds at universe-valued fibres exactly as it does
anywhere else (`interp_univ_cod_inversion` is the instance, proved by
the general lemma with no extra hypothesis).

A `Type`-level abstraction is never `pt` (`lamR_ne_pt`), and the proof
point inhabits no graph-regime product (`not_pt_mem_piR_pos`), so
`ConLeche/SetTheory/Core.lean`'s transitivity clause and the ω-chain
need no change for this layer.

Two further facts are proved below:

* **The formation law is the `imax` rule, exactly** (`piR_mem_univ`),
  and it is *sharp*: a graph-regime product with inhabited fibres is
  never a truth value (`piR_pos_not_mem_univZero`).
* **The proof point is not in `univ 0` at all**
  (`pt_not_mem_univZero`), and the empty-domain graph-regime product
  `piR v ∅ B = {∅}` does not contain it.
